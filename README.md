# SBA-Loan-Approval

One day, while surfing on my phone, I saw a video of the movie "The Big Short." It brought my attention to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.
So I decided to look into lending practices used to give out loans and the main factors behind determining which loan is high risk.
I learned about the Small Business Administration and its vast history of funding various entrepreneurial ventures during my research.

For my readers, assume you are a loan officer at a bank and are asked to approve or deny a loan by assessing its risk of default.
The business objective, and your task, is to help the hierarchy understand the factors that increase the risk of repayment default.
Our analysis will make the loan approval process easier & reduce the bank's probability of an unprofitable transaction.

My approach is divided into the following sections:
1.	Data cleaning - drop unnecessary columns, fill in missing values
2. 	Feature engineering - build new features for a deeper understanding
3.	Outlier detection & removal - identify extreme outliers and remove them
4.	Exploratory data analysis - look at the cleaned data & distribution of the approved amount
5.	Data visualization - display visually appealing plots and histograms
6.	Model building - construct multiple models (logistic regression, decision trees, xgboost)

In the end, I concluded the factor that contributed the most to whether or not a loan defaulted was the loan's Term length.

Here are some of the visualizations:
